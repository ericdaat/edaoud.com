  <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I am Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer from France.</p>

    <p>My background is computer science. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in General Engineering from <a href="https://ecam.fr">ECAM Lyon</a>, and an advanced master in Software Engineering from <a href="http://www.centralesupelec.fr/">Centrale Paris.</a><br>
    After graduating from Centrale, I went working for <a href="https://manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>, a french e-commerce startup specialised in DIY and gardening. I spent 2.5 years there. I pioneered product recommendations by building a recommender API from scratch, that increased average basket by 15%. I was in charge of the whole project and I learned a lot about Data Science, Data Engineering & Devops. I also worked on product classification, and user tracking.<br>
    I eventually left <a href="https://manomano.fr">ManoMano</a> to join <a href="https://doctrine.fr">Doctrine</a>, a french legal tech startup, to work on Natural Language Processing. I worked on a Named Entity Recognition algorithm used for anonymising legal decisions. I also helped cleaning the code base and setting best development practices.<p>

    <p>Besides work, I love music and especially guitar. I have been playing for 14 years now, recording videos on <a href="https://youtube.com/ericmusic13">YouTube</a>. I also love photography and I upload my pictures on <a href="https://500px.com/ericda">500px</a>. Sportswise, I have been practicing karate for 14 years, I am now black belt. I also like working on tech projects, like a movie recommender system and writing tech articles on my personal <a href="https://ericdaat.github.io">blog</a>.</p>

      <p>Notflix is an open source movie recommender system, inspired by a famous movie company. I am using the data from Movielens
      to build recommendation algorithms and expose them to users via a web application.</p>

      <p>As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO, and I had the chance to listen to KSHE 95 every day, playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes. Unfortunately, I can't listen to this radio in France as they block it. Fortunately, their website shows the songs that have been playing earlier. I decided to scrap this page, make myself an empty Spotify playlist, and automatically add in the KSHE tracks.</p>
